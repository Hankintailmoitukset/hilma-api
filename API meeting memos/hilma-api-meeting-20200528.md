## National notice validation ready for testing
 
The validation can  be tested in test-environment. More info can be found on the main readme document.

## Upcoming spelling change in the EtsNoticeContract

In EtsNoticeContract there is a misspelled property in ConditionsInformation section called {CiriteriaForTheSelectionOfParticipants}.
The property will be renamed to {CriteriaForTheSelectionOfParticipants}. This will be implemented backward compatible way so that both 
names can be used during a transition period. More information will be provided when the change is implemented.

## Issued with F03 contact  award notices

There has been several cases when TED has rejected F03 because it has been referencing corrigendum notice instead of the actual contract notice.
This should be avoided when possible.

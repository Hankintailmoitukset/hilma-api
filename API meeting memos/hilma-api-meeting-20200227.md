## Topics

### From previous meeting

* NUTS codes from non-eu regions are now implemented in Hilma. The up to date list is available in this repo. EU comission has also instructed on the usage of NUTS codes
  * The code needs to be as specific as possible. Examples:
    * when describing a location of a specific address, level 3 code is always required.
    * when describing a mainplace_delivery or such, other levels might also be acceptable. Calls for tenders for national / regional projects, which cannot be pinpointed on specific subregion, can be level 1 or 2
* F17 notices now return the generated XML document like other notices. As additional bonus, the XSD validation also works.

## Topics

### From previous meeting

* TED Publication API now available in test environment
  * The notice publish can be stopper while the notice is not scheduled for TED publish
  * If the notice publish is cancelled because of wrong information, a new notice with new identifier has to be submitted because TED rejects notices with same notice number after publication is cancelled.

### Upcoming API changes/features

* New notice TED state that depicts that notice has been approved by TED to be published.
* Hilma team will notify when new state is testable

## eForms
### SDK 1.12 update
- Gathering info/changelog about what has changed and what changes need to be implemented
- Draft-API. Previously there have been validation problems after update, let's try to prevent problems in 1.12 update
  - 1.12 will be tested in test environment before go-live

### National eForms
- BT fields will be used
- For national fields some prefix will be used (e.g. FI-1234)
- only work on 1.12, not 1.10
  - For other notices, 1.10 notices will be accepted until the EOL specified by TED

### Validation
- No timetable for validation yet. Validation is currently WIP.

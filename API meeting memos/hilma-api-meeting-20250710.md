## SDK Update
- Sending EU eForms notices to TED using SDK 1.13 via the API is now possible in Hilma Test and Prod environment.
	- Please note that to use SDK 1.13 the notice XML / draft JSON has to have the CustomizationID element with value "eforms-sdk-1.13". If the element is missing, the API will default to SDK 1.10.
- The SDK 1.13 version was released on Hilma on 24.6. The EED, IPI and FSR fields have not yet been implemented in Hilma. The timetable for the implementation of these fields will be specified at a later date. Please note that publishing SDK 1.10 drafts is not anymore possible in test or production environments.
- TED and Hilma will not accept notices for version 1.10 after 31.7.2025.

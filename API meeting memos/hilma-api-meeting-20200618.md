## Problems with corrigendums

The commission has published detailed instructions for information that can be corrected with F14 corrigendum

Possible changes in Hilma in the future:
* only allow creating corrigendums if the notice is published in TED, otherwise notice publication needs to be canceled and sent again
* stricter validation for what can be modified in a corrigendum

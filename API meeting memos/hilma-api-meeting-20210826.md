# eForms

eForms terminology unifying project in progress, current schedule:
  * Q3 / 2021 project presentation and comments
  * Q4 / 2021 Project results are handed to ministry

Questions raised:
  * Do we need all criterias on the eForms or is it still allowed to reference external documents? (ie. excels with complex formulas)
  * Lots could have different due dates related to the tendering process?
    * This could have lots of implications for how the process is handled, ie. separate decisions per lots and opening the tenders?
    * This might have huge effect on the workload and schedule.
    * Would this be something that can be decided on national level? 
  * How will ESPD be handled? Will they stay as external references, or do we need to embed them into eForms?
  * How will the changes and corrigendums be handled for notices in legacy format?
    * Will all new notices be required in the new eForms format? 
    * This might be an issue because the new format seems to track changes in itself instead of separate notices.


* eForms going live 14.11.2022 ? This is more probable in H1 2023. 
  * Hard to commit on schedule currently, because the specifications still need clarification.
  * Maybe best to avoid unnecessarily pushing it too far in the future

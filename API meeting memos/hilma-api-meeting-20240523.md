* **NEW NATIONAL TAILORING:**
  * eForms SDK 1.10 changed field BT-105 (tendering process / menettelyn tyyppi) forbidden for concession notice types (EF14, EF19, EF32, EF35).
    Finnish national law requires tendering process to be described in these notices.
    Due to that change we are planning to make BT-88 (Procedure features / menettelyn kuvaus) required for the above notice types.

* EForms
  * FYI. Hilma is going live with SDK 1.10.2 in the upcoming release ( NO API changes required )

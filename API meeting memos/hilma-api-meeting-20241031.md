    - Publication of all old-style notices is still possible
- 19.2.2025
    - SDK 1.13 version in use.
        - Hilma team plans to go directly to version 1.13 from 1.10. There are minor differences between 1.12 and 1.13
        - At least version 1.12 must be in use by February 28th 2025

    - National notices (E1, E3 and E4) can be sent to TED
        - SDK 1.13 must be in use to send to TED

    - All other national notices can be made in eForms format
    - Publication of all old-style notices is still possible
- 6.6.2025
    - All new notices has to be in eForms format
    - Publication of old-style notices is no longer possible
    - It’s possible to publish corrigendum notices in old-style format
- 8.1.2026
    - It’s no longer possible to publish corrigendum notices in old-style format
    - DPS procurement notice’s corrigendum notice has to be made in eForms format

## Remarks about the timetable
- Fast test environment release of E1/E3/E4 is of the highest priority
- It may be possible for Hilma partners to start using SDK 1.13 during February. We will follow-up on this in later API meetings
- 6.6.2025 seems to be quite a fast schedule for stopping the publication of other national notices in old-style format. The 1 month transition period raises concern but needs follow-up in later API meetings.
- How exactly will DPS procurement notice's corrigendum notices be made after 8.1.2026 for DPS's that run e.g. from 2023 to 2028? The process requires extra clarification from Hansel Hilma team

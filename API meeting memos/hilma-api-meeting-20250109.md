# Topics

## National eForms notices
- Timetable stays as is
- Schedule on when this can be tested will be notified as soon as there is information to give, the sooner the better

## National tailoring for TED fields in national notices
- Definitions available in [Github](https://github.com/Hankintailmoitukset/hilma-api/blob/master/National%20eForms%20Hilma%20tailored%20fields.xml?utm_source=emaileri&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Hilma%20API-kokous%209*1*2025*Hilma%20API%20meeting%209*1*2025&utm_term=National%20tailoring%20for%20TED%20fields&utm_content=u-5341820-84760694-2541467-0) 

## Open questions from last meeting
- Question 1: how to signal Hilma that the notice will be sent to TED? The answer to this is the custom tailored FI-20 field so the information will be as a field in the form.
- Question 2: what custom fields will national E1, E3 and E4 notices contain and how will they appear in the form XML? All the fields in the specification excel will appear on the form and our current plan is to provide you with XSDs relating to these fields as soon as possible.
- Question 3: validation. We have preliminary versions of E1 and E3 Schematrons ready and we aim to release those in Github later this week.

# Schematrons
## About
The schematron files in this directory are generated automatically (if not stated otherwise) based on data provided 
based on `nationalfields.json` and `nationalrules.json`. See readme.md in nationalValidator directory for more indepth information.

## Usage
We use these schematrons in conjuction with TED-OP schematrons (this can be clearly seen in the `hilma-validation.sch`) to generate the stylesheets used to validate XML.
